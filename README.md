# woolworths
A new Woolworths mobile app using the Woolworths API built with Angular and Ionic

This project uses the Woolworths API http://app.woolworthsonline.com.au/ to create an updated Woolworths shopping app. 

It will have feature parity with some small exceptions to the current Woolworths app. This includes the ability to shop online and set your current store using geolocation.

Start the app as follows: 

1. git clone the application
2. npm install and bower install
3. grunt serve - NOTE: if grunt serve does not work and it gives no errors, go to Gruntfile.js and search for concurrent and switch it to either false.
